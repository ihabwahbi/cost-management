## Analysis Strategy

### Step 1: Identify Competitors and Leaders
```python
Task("web-search-researcher",
     f"""Identify and analyze competitors for {application_type}:
     
     Find:
     1. Direct competitors (similar functionality)
     2. Indirect competitors (solving similar problems)
     3. Industry leaders (best-in-class UI)
