    query="latest developments in [topic]",  # Keep under 400 chars
    topic="news",
    days=1,  # Last 24 hours
    max_results=10,
    search_depth="advanced",  # For relevant snippets
    chunks_per_source=3
)

# If deep analysis needed
if requires_implications_analysis:
    analysis = exa_deep_researcher_start(
        instructions="Analyze implications of [news event]",
        model="exa-research"
    )
```

### 2. Company & Business Intelligence

```python
# Exa for semantic paper discovery
papers = exa_web_search_exa(
    query="If you're looking for groundbreaking research on [topic]:",
    numResults=20  # Cast wider net
)

# Tavily for specific academic domains
academic_sources = tavily_search(
    query="[specific technical term]",
    include_domains=["arxiv.org", "scholar.google.com", "ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"],
    max_results=10,
    time_range="year"
)
```

### 4. Documentation & Technical Content
**Use Two-Step Process for Maximum Efficiency**

```python
# Step 1: Broad search with both platforms
exa_results = exa_web_search_exa(
    query="implementation guide for [technology]",
    numResults=10
)

tavily_results = tavily_search(
    query="[technology] documentation tutorial",  # Under 400 chars
    max_results=15,
    search_depth="basic"  # Just URLs first
)

# Step 2: Smart extraction
# Filter by score (Tavily) or relevance (Exa)
relevant_urls = [r.url for r in results if r.score > 0.5]

# Tavily Extract for detailed content
extracted = tavily_extract(
    urls=relevant_urls[:5],
    format="markdown"
)
```

### 5. Deep Site Exploration
**Primary: Tavily Crawl | Alternative: Exa subpages**

```python
# Tavily for comprehensive site crawling
site_content = tavily_crawl(
    url="https://docs.example.com",
    max_depth=2,
    max_breadth=50,
    select_paths=["/docs/.*", "/api/.*"],
    exclude_paths=["/archive/.*"],
    instructions="Find all API endpoint documentation"
)

# Or Tavily Map first for structure
site_structure = tavily_map(
    url="https://example.com",
    max_depth=2
)
# Then targeted crawl based on discovered paths
```

### 6. Complex Multi-Step Research
**Primary: Exa Deep Research | Fallback: Manual orchestration**

```python
# For complex questions requiring synthesis
research_task = exa_deep_researcher_start(
    instructions="""
    Research [complex topic]:
    1. Identify key players and timeline
    2. Analyze market dynamics
    3. Compare competing solutions

    Return structured analysis with citations.
    """,
    model="exa-research-pro"  # For complex tasks
)

# Poll for results (45-180s for pro model)
while not completed:
    status = exa_deep_researcher_check(task_id)
```

### 7. Personal Sites & Niche Content
**Primary: Exa Neural | Verification: Tavily exclude mainstream**

```python
# Exa excels at finding personal/niche sites
personal_sites = exa_web_search_exa(
    query="Here's a personal blog about [niche topic]:",
    numResults=15
)

# Tavily with mainstream exclusion
niche_content = tavily_search(
    query="[niche topic] personal experience",
    exclude_domains=["wikipedia.org", "reddit.com", "medium.com"],
    max_results=10
)
```

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Optimizations

### Tavily Best Practices

#### Query Optimization
- **Keep queries under 400 characters** - Think search, not prompts
- **Break complex queries into sub-queries** for better results
- **Use metadata for filtering** - Leverage score, title, content fields

#### Parameter Optimization
```python
# Optimal Tavily configuration
{
    "query": "concise search query",  # < 400 chars
    "search_depth": "advanced",  # For relevant snippets
    "chunks_per_source": 3,  # Multiple relevant sections
    "include_raw_content": True,  # When using advanced depth
    "max_results": 10,  # Balance coverage/relevance
    "time_range": "month",  # Or use start_date/end_date
    "auto_parameters": True,  # Let Tavily optimize
    "topic": "news",  # For breaking news only
    "days": 1  # With news topic
}
```

#### Two-Step Extraction Process
1. **Search Phase**: Multiple focused queries with `search_depth="advanced"`
2. **Filter Phase**: Score-based filtering (>0.5) or LLM ranking
3. **Extract Phase**: Use `extract_depth="advanced"` for complex pages

#### Domain Control
```python
# Regional control
"include_domains": ["*.com"],  # US sites
"exclude_domains": ["*.is"],  # Exclude Iceland
"country": "united states"  # Boost US results

# Trusted sources
"include_domains": ["sec.gov", "bloomberg.com"]
"exclude_domains": ["unreliablenews.com"]
```

### Exa Best Practices

#### Query Framing for Neural Search
```python
# Natural language framing
❌ "machine learning papers"
✅ "If you're looking for groundbreaking machine learning papers:"
✅ "Here's an excellent resource on machine learning:"
```

#### Search Type Selection
- **Auto (default)**: Best for most queries
- **Fast**: < 400ms for real-time apps
- **Neural**: Semantic/exploratory searches
- **Keyword**: Exact term matching

#### Deep Research Configuration
```python
# Structured output schema
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["findings"],
    "properties": {
        "findings": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "insight": {"type": "string"},
                    "evidence": {"type": "string"},
                    "confidence": {"type": "number"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Use with instructions
research = exa_deep_researcher_start(
    instructions="Detailed research prompt",
    model="exa-research",  # or exa-research-pro
    output_schema=schema
)
```

## 🎯 Hybrid Strategies for Maximum Impact

### Strategy 1: Parallel Initial Search
```python
# Launch both platforms simultaneously
exa_task = exa_web_search_exa(query, numResults=10)
tavily_task = tavily_search(query[:400], max_results=10)

# Combine and deduplicate results
all_results = merge_deduplicate(exa_task, tavily_task)
```

### Strategy 2: Sequential Depth
```python
# Quick Tavily scan
initial = tavily_search(query, max_results=5, search_depth="basic")

# Deep Exa exploration on promising leads
for promising_topic in initial:
    deep_dive = exa_deep_researcher_start(
        instructions=f"Deep analysis of {promising_topic}"
    )
```

### Strategy 3: Platform Specialization
```python
# News from Tavily
news = tavily_search(query, topic="news", days=1)

# Academic from Exa
papers = exa_web_search_exa(f"Research papers on {query}")

# Company data from Exa
companies = exa_company_research_exa(company_name)

# Site crawl from Tavily
documentation = tavily_crawl(doc_site_url)
```

## 📊 Performance & Cost Optimization

### Speed Optimization
- **Tavily**: Use `search_depth="basic"` initially, upgrade if needed
- **Exa**: Use Fast search for latency-critical ops
- **Parallel**: Run independent searches simultaneously
- **Caching**: Avoid re-crawling with `livecrawl="fallback"`

### Cost Management
```python
# Tavily cost control
"search_depth": "basic",  # 1 credit vs 2 for advanced
"auto_parameters": False,  # Prevent auto-upgrade
"max_results": 5  # Limit results

# Exa cost control
searchType: "fast",  # Cheaper than neural
numResults: 5,  # Limit API calls
# Avoid Deep Research for simple queries
```

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs
```
High Quality, Slower:
- Exa Deep Research Pro
- Tavily advanced depth with crawl
- Multiple platform verification

Balanced:
- Exa Auto search
- Tavily advanced search
- Two-step extraction

Fast, Lower Quality:
- Exa Fast search
- Tavily basic depth
- Single platform
```

## 🔍 Advanced Techniques

### Regex Post-Processing (Tavily)
```python
import re

# Extract specific patterns from raw_content
emails = re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", content)
dates = re.findall(r"\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}", content)
prices = re.findall(r"\$[\d,]+\.?\d*", content)
```

### Score-Based Filtering
```python
# Tavily score filtering
relevant = [r for r in results if r.score > 0.5]

# Combined scoring
def combined_score(result):
    tavily_score = result.get('score', 0)
    title_relevance = keyword in result.get('title', '').lower()
    return tavily_score + (0.2 if title_relevance else 0)
```

### Asynchronous Operations
```python
import asyncio

async def comprehensive_search(query):
    # Run all searches in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        exa_search(query),
        tavily_search(query[:400]),
        exa_company_research(extract_company(query)),
        return_exceptions=True
    )
    return process_results(results)
```
