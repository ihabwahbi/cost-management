# Agent System Prompt Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented focused component verification updates across all 4 primary agents to prevent work on orphaned components. The changes are optimized and non-bloating, adding only essential verification steps.

## Changes Applied

### 1. DiagnosticsResearcher âœ…

#### Added Component Activity Verification Pattern (Line 179)
- New pattern to verify components are active before investigating
- Detects anti-pattern suffixes (-fixed, -v2, -worldclass)
- Redirects to base components automatically
- Returns only active components for investigation

#### Updated Phase 2 Workflow (Line 481)
- Added component verification BEFORE parallel investigations
- Logs warnings for orphaned components
- Only investigates verified active components

#### Enhanced Environment Rules (Line 603)
- Added rules for handling version suffixes
- Skip orphaned components automatically
- Focus on actively imported versions only

#### Updated Diagnostic Report Metadata (Line 508)
- Added `component_verification` section to track:
  - Active components found
  - Orphaned components skipped
  - Anti-patterns detected

### 2. DesignIdeator âœ…

#### Added Component Verification Step (Line 336)
- New step 1.1a for verifying components from diagnostics
- Checks for version suffixes and redirects to base
- Warns about anti-patterns
- Prevents designing for orphaned components

#### Updated Component Analyzer Task (Line 103)
- Enhanced to verify component import status
- Flags files with version suffixes as anti-patterns
- Reports active vs orphaned components

#### Enhanced Environment Rules (Line 514)
- Design for base components when version suffixes found
- Exclude orphaned components from proposals
- Target only actively imported versions

### 3. ModernizationOrchestrator âœ…

#### Added Component Target Verification Pattern (Line 324)
- New pattern to verify all plan components are active
- Detects and redirects from versioned to base components
- Adds critical constraints to prevent new versions

#### Updated Context Absorption (Line 411)
- Added step 6 to verify component targets
- Applies redirects automatically
- Logs component verification results

#### Enhanced Environment Rules (Line 666)
- Plan updates to base components only
- Exclude orphaned components from plans
- Target only imported/active versions

### 4. ModernizationImplementer âœ…

#### Added Pre-Implementation Verification (Line 656)
- New Phase 2.0 for component verification BEFORE any edits
- Prevents modifications to anti-pattern files
- Automatically redirects to active components
- Throws errors for orphaned components

#### Added Final Validation Check (Line 842)
- New Phase 5.0 to verify all modified components are active
- Checks for anti-pattern files in git diff
- Warns about changes to orphaned components
- Exits with error if anti-patterns modified

#### Enhanced Global Patterns (Line 1081)
- Never modify -fixed/-v2/-worldclass suffixed files
- Refuse modification of non-imported components
- Only modify actively imported versions

## Key Features of Implementation

### ðŸŽ¯ Focused & Optimized
- No bloat - only essential verification logic added
- Reuses existing patterns and structures
- Maintains agent readability and performance

### ðŸ”„ Automatic Redirection
- Detects versioned components and redirects to base
- Finds active alternatives for orphaned components
- Transparent logging of all redirections

### ðŸš« Anti-Pattern Prevention
- Prevents creation of new -fixed/-v2/-worldclass versions
- Flags existing anti-patterns for cleanup
- Enforces single-source-of-truth principle

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Tracking
- Component verification tracked in metadata
- Warnings logged at each phase
- Clear audit trail of decisions

---

## Testing Checklist

Test the updated agents with this scenario:

```bash
# Create test components
echo "export default function Test() { return <div>Base</div> }" > components/test.tsx
echo "export default function TestFixed() { return <div>Fixed</div> }" > components/test-fixed.tsx

# Import only the base in a page
echo "import Test from '@/components/test'" >> app/page.tsx

# Run diagnostic on test-fixed
DiagnosticsResearcher: Investigate rendering issue in test-fixed component
```

### Expected Behavior:

1. **DiagnosticsResearcher** should:
   - Detect test-fixed is orphaned
   - Find test is active
   - Redirect investigation to test
   - Report anti-pattern in diagnostic

2. **DesignIdeator** should:
   - Read component verification from diagnostic
   - Design only for active test component
   - Warn about test-fixed being orphaned

3. **ModernizationOrchestrator** should:
   - Redirect any test-fixed references to test
   - Add constraint against creating new versions
   - Plan only for test component

4. **ModernizationImplementer** should:
   - Refuse to modify test-fixed
   - Automatically work on test instead
   - Verify changes affect only test

## Impact Summary

### âœ… Problems Solved
- No more work on orphaned components
- No more creation of -fixed/-v2 versions
- All changes now affect actual UI
- Clear tracking of component status

### ðŸš€ Benefits
- Reduced confusion from multiple versions
- Faster debugging (working on right files)
- Cleaner codebase (no proliferation)
- Better audit trail of decisions

### ðŸ“ˆ Efficiency Gains
- Automatic redirection saves manual checking
- Early detection prevents wasted work
- Clear warnings prevent confusion
- Verification at each phase ensures correctness

## Next Steps

1. **Test the updates** with the provided scenario
2. **Monitor** for edge cases in real usage
3. **Consider** periodic cleanup of orphaned components
4. **Document** any additional patterns discovered

The agent system is now equipped to handle component verification systematically, preventing the issues we discovered and ensuring all work impacts the actual application.
