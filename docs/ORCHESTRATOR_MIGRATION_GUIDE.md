## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current System
```bash
# Backup existing orchestrator
cp .opencode/agent/modernization-orchestrator.md \
   .opencode/agent/modernization-orchestrator-backup.md

# Backup directory for safety
mkdir -p .claude/agents/backup-orchestrator
cp .claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/backup-orchestrator/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 2: Deploy New Agent Files
```bash
# Primary agent
cp modernization-orchestrator-revamped.md \
   .opencode/agent/modernization-orchestrator.md

# New subagents
cp library-update-monitor.md .claude/agents/
cp test-coverage-analyzer.md .claude/agents/

# Existing subagents already deployed from previous migrations
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check new subagents are present
ls -la .claude/agents/ | grep -E "(library-update|test-coverage)"

# Should see:
# - library-update-monitor.md
# - test-coverage-analyzer.md
```

### Step 4: Update Agent References
The new system uses these standardized references:
```yaml
## Agent References
COMPONENT_ANALYZER: "component-pattern-analyzer"
WEB_RESEARCHER: "web-search-researcher"
DOC_VERIFIER: "documentation-verifier"
LIBRARY_MONITOR: "library-update-monitor"
PERF_PROFILER: "performance-profiler"
ACCESSIBILITY_AUDITOR: "accessibility-auditor"
TEST_ANALYZER: "test-coverage-analyzer"
```

### Step 5: Test the New System
```bash
# Test complete orchestration flow
ModernizationOrchestrator: Create plan from diagnostics and design proposal

# Verify:
# - Reads both Phase 1 and Phase 2 documents
# - Launches parallel technical analyses
# - All 7 subagents available and functional
# - Risk assessment performed
# - Dependencies validated
# - Implementation priorities established
```

## 🔄 Output Format Changes

```

### New Plan Sections

#### Risk Mitigation Matrix
```markdown
## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| State refactor breaks features | Medium | High | Feature flags + incremental |
| Dependency conflict | Low | Critical | Version lock + staged upgrade |
```

#### Dependency Resolution
```markdown
## Dependency Management

### Immediate Updates (Security)
- package@1.2.3 → 1.2.5 (CVE-2024-XXXX)

### Coupled Dependencies
- react@17 → 18 + react-dom@17 → 18 (must upgrade together)
```

#### Test Requirements
```markdown
## Test Coverage Requirements

### Critical Paths Needing Tests
1. Authentication flow - 0% coverage currently
2. Payment processing - Unit tests missing
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### Effective Synthesis
```python
# Always validate no conflicts
if diagnostic_requirement conflicts with design_spec:
    prioritize(diagnostic_requirement)  # Fixes first
    adapt(design_spec)  # Design accommodates
```

### Risk Management
```python
# Assess every significant change
for change in implementation_tasks:
    risk = assess_risk(change)
    if risk.level >= "High":
        add_mitigation(risk)
        add_validation(change)
```

### Dependency Safety
```python
# Check compatibility before planning
compatibility = Task(LIBRARY_MONITOR, dependency_check)
if not compatibility.safe:
    plan_staged_upgrade()
```

### Test Planning
```python
# Identify gaps for critical paths
coverage = Task(TEST_ANALYZER, coverage_analysis)
for critical_path in business_critical:
    if coverage[critical_path] < THRESHOLD:
        add_test_requirement(priority="High")
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Missing context documents
**Solution**: Ensure Phase 1 & 2 completed and documents exist

### Issue: Subagent not found
**Solution**: Verify all 7 subagents deployed to `.claude/agents/`

### Issue: Risk assessment incomplete
**Solution**: Check all parallel analyses completed successfully

### Issue: Dependencies unresolved
**Solution**: Ensure library-update-monitor has package.json access

### Issue: Low confidence score
**Solution**: Review missing validations and add necessary checks

## Integration with Workflow

The orchestrator now perfectly bridges:

### From Phase 1 (Diagnostics)
- All bugs → Implementation tasks
- Root causes → Fix specifications
- Debug needs → Instrumentation plans

### From Phase 2 (Design)
- Design specs → Technical requirements
- UI changes → Component modifications
- Mockups → Implementation guides

### To Phase 4 (Implementation)
- Clear priorities → Execution order
- Risk mitigations → Safety measures
- Test requirements → Quality validation
- Success criteria → Completion definition

## Summary

This migration transforms modernization-orchestrator from a basic plan generator into a sophisticated synthesis engine that:

- **Merges** multi-phase context seamlessly
- **Validates** technical feasibility thoroughly
- **Manages** dependencies proactively
- **Assesses** risks systematically
- **Plans** with surgical precision

The addition of library-update-monitor and test-coverage-analyzer completes the orchestrator's analytical capabilities, ensuring every plan addresses:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Version compatibility
- Test coverage gaps
- Quality requirements
- Risk mitigation

Combined with the revamped diagnostics-researcher (Phase 1) and design-ideator (Phase 2), you now have three-quarters of your workflow operating at peak efficiency, ready to deliver comprehensive implementation blueprints that guarantee Phase 4 success.

The investment in this migration yields:
- Reduced implementation surprises
- Fewer dependency conflicts
- Better risk management
- Higher quality outcomes
- Faster execution confidence

Proceed with confidence - your orchestrator now has the intelligence to synthesize, validate, and plan at the level of sophistication your brownfield modernization demands.
