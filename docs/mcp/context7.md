GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI pair programmer, but its recommendations can be significantly enhanced when it has access to specific context about your technical products. Context7 is a tool designed to help ground large language models with your documentation, providing more accurate and relevant recommendations. This guide shows you how to leverage Context7 to improve Copilot's understanding of your technical ecosystem.

What is Context7 MCP?
Context7 is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides up-to-date code documentation directly to AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on outdated training data, Context7 MCP pulls the latest documentation and code examples from source repositories, ensuring your AI coding assistant has access to current information. With Context7 MCP:

Get code examples based on the latest library versions, not outdated training data
Eliminate hallucinated APIs that don't actually exist
Receive correct, version-specific documentation for the libraries you're using
Access contextually relevant code snippets directly in your coding environment
Getting Started with Context7 MCP
Installation Options
Context7 MCP is available for various AI coding assistants. The most common installation methods are:

For Cursor:

BASHCopy
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
For VS Code with GitHub Copilot:

BASHCopy
# Install the MCP extension first
code --install-extension ms-vscode.mcp-server

# Then install Context7 MCP
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
For other MCP clients like Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc., visit the [Context7 GitHub repository](https://github.com/upstash/context7) for specific installation instructions.

Using Context7 MCP with GitHub Copilot
The Simple "use context7" Approach
The most straightforward way to leverage Context7 with GitHub Copilot is to add the phrase use context7 to your prompts:

Open GitHub Copilot Chat in your editor

Write your prompt normally

Add "use context7" at the end of your prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Create a React component that fetches data from an API and displays it in a table. use context7
When you include "use context7" in your prompt, Context7 MCP will automatically:

Identify relevant libraries in your prompt (React, fetch API, etc.)
Fetch the latest documentation for those libraries
Insert that documentation into the context window for Copilot
Let Copilot generate code based on up-to-date information
Targeting Specific Libraries
For more control, you can specify which libraries you want documentation for:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Show me how to set up authentication with Passport.js for a Node.js Express app. use context7 for passport, express
Getting Version-Specific Documentation
You can also specify a particular version of a library:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Create a Next.js API route that connects to MongoDB. Use Next.js 13 app router. use context7
Real-World Examples
Example 1: Leveraging Current Documentation
Without Context7:

Prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
How do I create a Next.js app with app router?
Response without Context7:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Copilot might respond with outdated create-next-app commands or patterns that don't reflect the latest app router features.
With Context7:

Prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
How do I create a Next.js app with app router? use context7
Response with Context7:

PLAINTEXTCopy
To create a new Next.js app with the app router, you can run:

npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app

During the setup, you'll be asked a few questions:
- When asked about using App Router, select 'Yes'
- Choose your preferred styling approach
- Configure other options as needed

The app router structure will be automatically set up with a main app/ directory instead of the older pages/ approach. Inside app/, you can create route segments with page.js, layout.js and other special files.
Example 2: Correct API References
Without Context7:

Prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
How do I implement authentication in Supabase?
Response without Context7:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Copilot might generate code with outdated or incorrect API methods.
With Context7:

Prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
How do I implement authentication in Supabase? use context7
Response with Context7:

Here's how to implement authentication with the latest Supabase JavaScript client:

TYPESCRIPTCopy

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project.supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)

// Sign up a new user
async function signUp(email, password) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password
  })
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error signing up:', error.message)
    return null
  }
  
  return data
}

// Sign in existing user
async function signIn(email, password) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password
  })
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error signing in:', error.message)
    return null
  }
  
  return data
}
Best Practices for Using Context7 MCP
Getting the Most Out of Context7 MCP
Be specific about libraries: Mention the specific libraries or frameworks you're working with
Include version information: Specify versions when relevant ("Next.js 13" instead of just "Next.js")
Place "use context7" at the end: For best results, place this trigger phrase at the end of your prompt
Be patient with first request: The first "use context7" call might take slightly longer as it initializes
When to Use Context7 MCP
Context7 MCP is particularly valuable when:

Working with rapidly evolving libraries: Frameworks that change frequently benefit most
Learning new APIs: Get accurate examples when exploring unfamiliar libraries
Debugging dependency issues: Get version-specific guidance for compatibility problems
Creating production code: Ensure generated code follows current best practices
Advanced Features
Adding Custom Documentation
Library authors can add their projects to Context7 at the submission page [https://context7.com/add-library](https://context7.com/add-library)

You can also add configuration for better indexing by adding a context7.json file to your repository:

JSONCopy
{
  "$schema": "https://context7.com/schema/context7.json",
  "projectTitle": "My Amazing Library",
  "description": "A helpful description of what the library does",
  "folders": ["docs/", "examples/"],
  "excludeFolders": ["src/internal"],
  "rules": ["Always initialize before use", "Close connections properly"]
}
Multiple Libraries in One Prompt
You can request documentation for multiple libraries in a single prompt:

PLAINTEXTCopy
Create a React component that fetches data from MongoDB and uses TailwindCSS for styling. use context7 for react, mongodb, tailwindcss
Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions:

Context7 seems unresponsive: Verify that the MCP server is running (npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest)
Documentation seems outdated: Try specifying the exact version you need in your prompt
Missing library documentation: Submit the library to Context7 if it's not already available
Long response times: Some large documentation sets may take longer to process the first time
Conclusion
Context7 MCP solves one of the biggest challenges with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot - outdated or hallucinated documentation references. By providing up-to-date, accurate library documentation directly in the context window, you get more reliable code suggestions that work with the current versions of your libraries.

The simple "use context7" phrase transforms your Copilot experience from guesswork based on outdated training data to precision coding based on the latest documentation. This results in fewer debugging sessions, less time spent correcting generated code, and a more productive development workflow overall.
