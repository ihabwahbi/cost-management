# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.1 - Foundation Setup

gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Comprehensive test suite resolves critical blocker (82 passing tests). Only remaining concern is tRPC Edge Function deployment to Supabase - functionality proven via integration tests but not operationally deployed. Team decision required on AC3 interpretation."
