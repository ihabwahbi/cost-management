# Story 1.2.1: KPICard Cleanup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to align Story 1.2 implementation with the finalized Living Blueprint Architecture principles,
**so that** the codebase maintains absolute leanness and serves as the correct pattern for all future Cell migrations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Directory renamed to `kpi-card/` (no v2 suffix)
2. Manifest ID updated to `kpi-card` (no v2)
3. Feature flag removed from all files
4. Old component deleted from `components/dashboard/kpi-card.tsx`
5. Dashboard page uses Cell directly (no conditional rendering)
6. All tests pass after cleanup
7. Ledger updated with cleanup entry
8. No references to "v2" or feature flags remain (verified via grep)

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Background Context

Story 1.2 (KPICard Pilot Cell) was implemented **before architecture finalization** using an earlier approach that included:
- ❌ Version suffix: `kpi-card-v2/` directory
- ❌ Feature flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_KPI_CARD_V2`
- ❌ Parallel implementations: Both old and new components coexist
- ❌ Conditional rendering based on feature flag

The finalized Living Blueprint Architecture requires:
- ✅ Clean names: `kpi-card/` (no version suffixes)
- ✅ No feature flags: Direct replacement only
- ✅ Single implementation: Old component deleted
- ✅ Lean codebase: Optimized for AI agent clarity

This cleanup story removes all vestiges of the OLD approach and establishes the correct pattern for Story 1.3 and beyond.

### Relevant Source Tree

```
apps/web/
├── components/
│   ├── cells/
│   │   └── kpi-card-v2/          # TO BE RENAMED: kpi-card/
│   │       ├── component.tsx
│   │       ├── state.ts
│   │       ├── manifest.json     # ID needs update
│   │       └── pipeline.yaml
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── kpi-card.tsx          # TO BE DELETED
├── app/
│   └── projects/[id]/dashboard/
│       └── page.tsx              # Contains feature flag logic to remove
└── .env.example                  # Contains NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_KPI_CARD_V2
```

### Why This Cleanup Matters

**For AI Agent Optimization:**
- Agents query ledger for "kpi-card" and get ONE result (not kpi-card vs kpi-card-v2)
- No conditional logic to parse (feature flags confuse agents)
- Clear, unambiguous component names
- Single source of truth per feature

**For 100% Architecture Adoption:**
- This establishes the CORRECT pattern for all future stories
- Story 1.3 (PLCommandCenter) must follow this pattern from the start
- Every future epic must follow this pattern
- The goal is complete refactor, not hybrid coexistence

**For Codebase Leanness:**
- Eliminates dead code (old component)
- Eliminates versioning complexity
- Reduces cognitive overhead
- Faster navigation and search

### Critical Success Factor

This story validates that the cleanup workflow works correctly. If successful, all future Cell migration stories will follow this exact pattern:
1. Create Cell with clean name (no v2)
2. Update imports
3. Delete old component in SAME story
4. Commit with only new Cell

### Estimated Duration
2-3 hours

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/components/cells/kpi-card/__tests__/component.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/__tests__/dashboard.test.tsx`
- E2E tests: `apps/web/__tests__/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`

**Testing Requirements:**
- All existing KPI card tests must pass after renaming
- Verify no regressions in dashboard functionality
- Run full test suite: `pnpm test`
- Run build to ensure no TypeScript errors: `pnpm build`
- Manual browser testing: `pnpm dev` and verify dashboard renders correctly

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Unit/Integration: Vitest
- E2E: Playwright
- Type checking: TypeScript compiler (tsc)

### File List

**Modified Files:**

- `apps/web/components/cells/kpi-card/component.tsx` - Renamed component from KPICardV2 to KPICard
- `apps/web/components/cells/kpi-card/__tests__/component.test.tsx` - Updated references to KPICard

- `docs/stories/1.2.1-kpicard-cleanup.md` - Marked all tasks complete

**Deleted Files:**

**Renamed Directories:**
- `apps/web/components/cells/kpi-card-v2/` → `apps/web/components/cells/kpi-card/`

### Key Learnings

**Architecture Cleanup Pattern:**
- The cleanup workflow validated the Living Blueprint Architecture principle of maintaining absolute leanness
- No versioning, no feature flags, single implementation - optimal for AI agent clarity
- Git-based safety approach works well (can revert entire commit if needed)

**Component Naming:**
- Important to update component export name along with directory rename
- Test files must also be updated to match new component names
- TypeScript compiler catches these mismatches effectively

**Verification Strategy:**
- grep verification is effective for catching lingering references
- Coverage and build artifacts can be safely ignored (regenerate automatically)
- Running full test suite + type check ensures no breakage

**Recommendations for Future Cleanups:**
- Always update component export names when renaming
- Run type check before committing to catch naming mismatches
- Document grep results to show thorough verification
- Keep ledger entries detailed for future reference

## QA Results

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] No files or directories with "v2" suffix
- [ ] No environment variables with "FEATURE_" prefix

- [ ] Old component completely removed
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration + e2e)
- [ ] Manual testing confirms functionality unchanged
- [ ] Ledger updated with cleanup entry
