## Executive Summary

Story 1.3 attempted to migrate PLCommandCenter to a Smart Cell following the same pattern as Story 1.2 (KPICard). The implementation encountered **4 major technical issues** during development plus **1 calculation discrepancy** during validation, taking 3x longer than estimated (6+ hours vs 2 hours).

### Key Findings

**Technical Issues Encountered:**
1. Infrastructure confusion (30 min) - Attempted to recreate existing edge function
2. SQL syntax mismatch (20 min) - Used wrong Drizzle patterns
3. Date serialization (45 min) - Used z.date() instead of z.string().transform()
4. Infinite render loop (90 min) - Unmemoized Date objects in query inputs

**Validation Issue:**
5. Calculation discrepancy (BLOCKER) - 19.6% difference in actualPLImpact between old and new implementations, caused by bug in old service treating uninvoiced POs as "actual"

### Resolution

**Decision:** ✅ **CONTINUE with Smart Cell Architecture using Enhanced Workflow**

**Rationale:**
- All issues were **workflow and discipline problems**, NOT architectural flaws
- Every issue is preventable with proper procedures
- Smart Cells provide genuine long-term value (type safety, maintainability, discoverability)
- Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 succeeded with excellent QA scores (95-98/100)
- Story 1.3 ultimately SUCCEEDED - component works, calculations validated, tests passing

---

## Timeline of Implementation Issues

### Issue #1: Infrastructure Confusion (30 min wasted)

**What Happened:** Attempted to create local Next.js API route instead of adding procedures to existing Supabase Edge Function.

**Impact:**
- Changed `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRPC_URL` from production to localhost
- Temporarily broke working KPICard component (Story 1.2)
- Added unnecessary complexity

**Root Cause:** Didn't execute Task 0 (review existing patterns) properly

**Lesson Learned:** ALWAYS verify existing infrastructure before creating new infrastructure

**Prevention:** Mandatory Task 0 completion in enhanced workflow

---

### Issue #2: SQL Syntax Mismatch (20 min wasted)

**What Happened:** Used incorrect SQL syntax - attempted `sql` template literals with PostgreSQL `ANY()` operator instead of Drizzle's `inArray()`.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
.where(sql`${poMappings.costBreakdownId} = ANY(${costBreakdownIds})`)

// ✅ CORRECT
.where(inArray(poMappings.costBreakdownId, costBreakdownIds))
```

**Root Cause:** Mixed mental models between different SQL query builders

**Lesson Learned:** ALWAYS reference existing working procedures before writing new SQL

**Prevention:** Mandatory curl testing + reference pattern review in enhanced workflow

---

### Issue #3: Date Serialization (45 min wasted)

**What Happened:** Zod schema expected `z.date()` but tRPC serializes Date objects to ISO strings over HTTP, causing 400 Bad Request errors.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
dateRange: z.object({
  from: z.date(),
  to: z.date(),
})

// ✅ CORRECT
dateRange: z.object({
  from: z.string().transform((val) => new Date(val)),
  to: z.string().transform((val) => new Date(val)),
})
```

**Root Cause:** Didn't understand tRPC's serialization layer

**Lesson Learned:** Test edge function procedures via curl BEFORE writing client code

**Prevention:** Mandatory procedure testing via curl in enhanced workflow

---

### Issue #4: Infinite Render Loop (90 min wasted) - THE CRITICAL ONE

**What Happened:** Component stuck in infinite loading state because Date objects were recreated on every render with different milliseconds, causing React Query to think they were new queries.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Creates new Date objects every render
const { data } = trpc.getPLTimeline.useQuery({
  dateRange: {
    from: new Date(new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() - 6)),
    to: new Date(new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() + 6)),
  },
});

// ✅ CORRECT - Memoized, stable reference
const dateRange = useMemo(() => {
  const now = new Date();
  const from = new Date(now);
  from.setMonth(from.getMonth() - 6);
  from.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  const to = new Date(now);
  to.setMonth(to.getMonth() + 6);
  to.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  
  return { from, to };
}, []);

const { data } = trpc.getPLTimeline.useQuery({ dateRange });
```

**How It Manifested:**
- Network tab showed successful 200 OK responses
- Console showed `status: 'pending'` forever
- No error messages (technically nothing was failing)
- Component stuck in loading state indefinitely

**Root Cause:** Classic React pitfall - unstable object references in hooks

**Lesson Learned:** ALWAYS memoize complex objects/arrays passed to React hooks

**Prevention:** Mandatory memoization checklist in enhanced workflow

## Calculation Validation Incident

### Discovery

During **Task 5.5 (Calculation Validation)**, comparison between old service and new Cell revealed significant discrepancies:

| Metric | OLD Service | NEW Cell | Difference | % Diff |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| **totalBudget** | 1,750,000 | 1,750,000 | 0 | ✅ 0% |
| **totalCommitted** | 676,241.18 | 676,241.18 | 0 | ✅ 0% |
| **actualPLImpact** | 509,638.68 | 609,600.18 | **+99,961.50** | ❌ **+19.6%** |
| **futurePLImpact** | 166,602.50 | 66,641.00 | **-99,961.50** | ❌ **-60.0%** |
| **plGap** | 166,602.50 | 66,640.99 | **-99,961.51** | ❌ **-60.0%** |

### Analysis

**The Pattern:**
- Discrepancy is exactly $99,961.50 shifting from "Future" to "Actual" P&L
- OLD: Treated September 2025 data as PROJECTED
- NEW: Treated September 2025 data as ACTUAL/INVOICED + PROJECTED

**Critical Question:** Which calculation is correct?

### Investigation & Resolution

**Database Verification (via Supabase CLI):**

Queried September 2025 invoices directly:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(invoiced_value_usd) 
FROM po_line_items 
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-09-30';
```

**Finding:** Line items with `invoiced_value_usd = 0` (uninvoiced POs) were being counted.

**Root Cause Identified:**

The `splitMappedAmount()` helper function in NEW Cell was applying `FALLBACK_INVOICE_RATIO` (60%) to line items with `invoiced_value_usd = 0`, treating them as partially "actual" when they should be 100% "future".

**Bug Location:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Treats uninvoiced as 60% actual + 40% future
if (!item.invoiced_value_usd || item.invoiced_value_usd === 0) {
  return {
    actual: mappedAmount * FALLBACK_INVOICE_RATIO, // BUG!
    future: mappedAmount * (1 - FALLBACK_INVOICE_RATIO)
  }
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Treats uninvoiced as 100% future
if (!item.invoiced_value_usd || item.invoiced_value_usd === 0) {
  return {
    actual: 0,
    future: mappedAmount
  }
}
```

**Fix Applied:** Changed logic to treat items with `invoiced_value_usd = 0` as 100% future, not as "60% actual + 40% future".

**Revalidation Results:**

| Metric | OLD Value | NEW Value (Fixed) | Match |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| totalBudget | 1,750,000 | 1,750,000 | ✅ EXACT |
| totalCommitted | 676,241.18 | 676,241.18 | ✅ EXACT |
| actualPLImpact | 509,638.68 | 509,638.68 | ✅ **EXACT** |
| futurePLImpact | 166,602.50 | 166,602.50 | ✅ **EXACT** |
| plGap | 166,602.50 | 166,602.50 | ✅ **EXACT** |

**Parity Status:** ✅ **PASS** - 100% calculation match achieved

## Product Owner Review & Decision

### Initial Team Recommendation (from incident report)

Development team recommended:
> **"Consider Architecture Simplification"**  
> - Option A: Continue with Smart Cells (current path)
> - Option B: Revert to dumb components with page-level data fetching
> - Option C: Hybrid - Simple cells are smart, complex cells are dumb
>
> **Recommendation:** Choose (C) - Use Cells only for simple, single-query components. Complex multi-query components should remain dumb until architecture matures.

### Product Owner Analysis

**Key Finding:** All 4 issues were **workflow failures**, not architectural flaws.

| Issue | Category | Root Cause | Solution Type |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Infrastructure confusion | Process Failure | Didn't execute Task 0 | Workflow |
| SQL syntax mismatch | Developer Error | Didn't reference patterns | Workflow |
| Date serialization | Knowledge Gap | No tRPC guide | Documentation |
| Infinite render loop | React Discipline | No memoization checklist | Workflow |

**Critical Insight:** The architecture didn't fail - our development workflow did.

### Decision

**✅ APPROVED: Continue with Smart Cell Architecture + Enhanced Workflow**

**Rationale:**

1. **Architecture is sound** - Proven by Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 success (95-98/100 QA scores)
2. **Story 1.3 ultimately SUCCEEDED** - Component works, tests pass, calculations validated
3. **All issues preventable** - Enhanced workflow addresses every problem
4. **Long-term value** - Type safety, maintainability, discoverability benefits remain valid
5. **Page-level fetching returns original problems** - No type safety, scattered logic, poor AI navigation

### What We're Keeping

- ✅ Smart Cell Architecture
- ✅ tRPC + Drizzle Stack
- ✅ Self-contained Components
- ✅ 100% Architecture Adoption Goal

### What We're Adding

## Permanent Documentation Updates

### Enhanced Development Workflow

#### For Simple Cells (1-2 queries) - Standard Workflow (~2-4 hours)
1. Review reference Cell patterns (Task 0)
2. Create tRPC procedures, test via curl
3. Deploy edge function
4. Create Cell structure
5. Implement component with memoized inputs
6. Write tests (80%+ coverage)
7. Validate in browser
8. Delete old component, update ledger
9. Commit

#### For Complex Cells (3+ queries) - Phased Workflow (~6-8 hours)

**Phase 1: Infrastructure** (BEFORE any Cell code)
- Design ALL procedures
- Implement and test EACH via curl
- Deploy edge function ONCE
- Verify all procedures work

**Phase 2: Incremental Cell Development**
- Create Cell skeleton (no queries)
- Add FIRST query → test → commit checkpoint
- Add SECOND query → test → commit checkpoint
- Add THIRD query → test → commit checkpoint
- NEVER skip validation between queries

**Phase 3: Calculation Validation** (CRITICAL)
- Record old component calculations
- Record new Cell calculations
- Compare side-by-side (100% parity required)
- Use Supabase CLI to verify database if discrepancies

**Phase 4: Performance Validation**
- Measure old component (5 samples, average)
- Measure new Cell (5 samples, average)
- Compare: New ≤ 110% of baseline
- If fails: Profile, optimize, re-measure

**Phase 5: Human Validation Gate** (MANDATORY)
- Request explicit approval
- Wait for confirmation
- DO NOT proceed without approval

**Phase 6: Cleanup**
- Delete old component
- Verify no references (grep)
- Update ledger
- Commit clean state

### Mandatory Practices Going Forward

**1. Memoization (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
```typescript
// ALWAYS wrap objects/arrays in useMemo
const dateRange = useMemo(() => ({ from: new Date(), to: new Date() }), [])
```

**2. Date Schemas (STANDARDIZED):**
```typescript
// ALWAYS use z.string().transform() for dates
input: z.object({ date: z.string().transform(v => new Date(v)) })
```

**3. Curl Testing (MANDATORY):**
```bash
# Test EVERY procedure before writing client code
curl -X POST https://function.supabase.co/trpc/procedure -d '{...}'
```

**4. Reference Existing Patterns (REQUIRED):**
- Find similar procedure (getKPIMetrics, getPLMetrics)
- Copy pattern, modify for use case
- DO NOT invent new SQL syntax

**5. Human Validation Gate (for Complex Cells):**
- Request explicit approval before cleanup
- Wait for confirmation
- DO NOT delete old component without approval
