## Summary of Fixes for Forecast Version Display Issue

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **State synchronization issue**: Forecast changes from wizard weren't being passed correctly to save function
2. **Loading order issue**: Cost breakdown was loaded before checking for forecast versions
3. **Missing data handling**: No fallback when forecast data is empty
4. **Version selection**: Active version state was global instead of per-project

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Fixed State Synchronization (CRITICAL)
- Created 'saveForecastVersionWithChanges' function that accepts changes directly from wizard
- Wizard now passes changes directly instead of relying on React state updates
- This ensures the correct forecast values are saved to the database

#### 2. Fixed Loading Order
- Now loads forecast versions FIRST, then decides whether to load base or versioned data
- If versions exist, loads the latest version by default
- If no versions exist, loads base cost breakdown

#### 3. Added Data Validation
- Added checks for empty forecast data with fallback to base data
- Added console logging to track data transformations
- Properly transforms forecasted_cost to budget_cost for display

#### 4. Fixed Version Management
- Made activeVersion state per-project (Record<string, number | 'latest'>)
- Properly initializes active version when project is expanded
- Version dropdown now correctly syncs with selected version

### Testing Instructions:
1. Create a new forecast with modified values
2. Check console logs to verify data is being saved correctly
3. Select different versions from dropdown - each should show different values
4. Version 0 should show original values
5. Version 1+ should show forecasted values

### What to Look for in Console:
- 'Creating forecast with changes:' - should show the modified values
- 'Saving forecast entries:' - should show correct number of entries
- 'Loaded version X for project Y:' - should show when versions are loaded
- 'Forecast item:' - shows the data transformation happening
