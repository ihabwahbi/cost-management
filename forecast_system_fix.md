## Complete Fix for Forecast Version System

### The Problem:
1. New entries added in forecasts were being rejected
2. The system was preventing users from adding new items in forecast versions
3. This severely limited the usefulness of the forecast feature

### The Solution Applied:

#### 1. Allow New Entries in ANY Version
- Removed the restriction that prevented new entries in forecast versions
- Both initial budgets AND forecasts can now add new entries to cost_breakdown
- Each version tracks its own set of entries via budget_forecasts

#### 2. How Version Display Works:
- **Version 0**: Shows only the entries that were saved in Version 0 budget_forecasts
- **Version 1+**: Shows all entries that were saved in that versions budget_forecasts
- Each version is a complete snapshot including both modified existing entries and new additions

#### 3. Data Structure:
- `cost_breakdown`: Contains ALL entries ever created for a project
- `budget_forecasts`: Links specific entries to specific versions with their values
- When displaying a version, we load from budget_forecasts which tells us:
  - Which entries to show
  - What values to display for each entry

### Example Flow:
1. Create initial budget with "Strings" at 450000
   - Saves to cost_breakdown
   - Creates Version 0 in budget_forecasts with this entry

2. Create forecast Version 1 with:
   - Modified "Strings" to 500000
   - New "Drums" at 300000
   - Saves "Drums" to cost_breakdown
   - Creates Version 1 in budget_forecasts with BOTH entries

3. When viewing:
   - Version 0: Shows only "Strings" at 450000
   - Version 1: Shows "Strings" at 500000 AND "Drums" at 300000

### Benefits:
- Users can add new items in any forecast
- Each version is a complete snapshot
- Version history properly maintained
- No data corruption of original budgets
