### Monolithic File Detection
**Critical Alert**: 2 files >500 lines detected

ðŸ”´ **ARCHITECTURAL EMERGENCY**

Monolithic files detected:
- `apps/web/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`: 726 lines
- `apps/web/components/version-comparison.tsx`: 616 lines

**Impact**: Severe violation of Radical Granularity principle (M-CELL-3)
**Action**: Immediate refactoring required

---

## Radical Granularity Adherence

### Component Size Distribution

**Cell Components** (apps/web/components/cells/):
```
â‰¤100 lines:    3 files (27%)
101-200 lines: 5 files (46%)
201-400 lines: 3 files (27%)
>400 lines:    0 files (0%) âœ“
```

**Non-Cell Components** (apps/web/components/):
```
â‰¤100 lines:    2 files (22%)
101-300 lines: 3 files (33%)
301-500 lines: 2 files (22%)
>500 lines:    2 files (22%) ðŸ”´
```

**M-CELL-3 Violations**: 2 files exceed 500 lines

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection

**Total Anti-Patterns**: 9
**Architecture Debt**: 41 points (threshold: 10, emergency: 20)

### Critical Severity (2)
- **Monolithic files**: 2 instances
  - Impact: Severe violation of Radical Granularity
  - Files: sidebar.tsx (726 lines), version-comparison.tsx (616 lines)
  - Debt: 20 points

### High Severity (7)
- **Non-Cell components with business logic**: 7 instances
  - Impact: Violates M-CELL-1, no behavioral contracts
  - Files: app-shell.tsx, filter-sidebar.tsx, inline-edit.tsx, po-table.tsx, version-comparison.tsx, version-history-timeline.tsx, version-panel.tsx
  - Debt: 21 points

### Medium Severity (0)
- Any types within acceptable range (0.11%)

---

## Trend Analysis

**Comparison Window**: Baseline (no historical data)

This is the first architecture health assessment, establishing baseline metrics for future trend analysis:

- Health Score: 53.5
- Type Safety: 98%
- Cell Quality: 100%
- Procedure Compliance: 100%
- Architecture Debt: 41 points
- Monolithic Files: 2
- M-CELL-1 Violations: 7

Future assessments will track improvement or degradation from this baseline.

## Strategic Recommendations

**Total Recommendations**: 3

### Urgent Priority (2)

#### 1. Refactor Monolithic Files
- **Issue**: 2 files exceed 500 lines
- **Impact**: Severe violation of Radical Granularity, degrades agent navigability
- **Recommendation**: Split into Cell architecture with manifest/pipeline
- **Effort**: 16 hours
- **Benefit**: Restores granularity, reduces debt by 20 points
- **Files**: 
  - sidebar.tsx (726 lines) â†’ sidebar Cell with sub-components
  - version-comparison.tsx (616 lines) â†’ version-comparison Cell

#### 2. Migrate Business Components to Cells
- **Issue**: 7 components with business logic outside Cell structure
- **Impact**: Violates M-CELL-1, no behavioral contracts for agents
- **Recommendation**: Convert to Cells with manifests documenting requirements
- **Effort**: 14 hours (2 hours per component)
- **Benefit**: Full M-CELL-1 compliance, reduces debt by 21 points
- **Components**: app-shell, filter-sidebar, inline-edit, po-table, version-comparison, version-history-timeline, version-panel

### High Priority (1)

#### 3. Extract Large Non-Cell Components
- **Issue**: 4 components exceed 300 lines
- **Impact**: Approaching monolithic status
- **Recommendation**: Decompose into smaller components
- **Effort**: 8 hours
- **Benefit**: Prevents future violations

## Governance Decision

### ðŸ”´ PAUSE - Migrations Halted

**Health Status**: POOR (53.5/100)
**Reasoning**: Architecture health below acceptable threshold with critical anti-patterns

**Critical Issues Blocking Progress**:
1. 2 monolithic files (>500 lines) - architectural emergency
2. Architecture debt at 41 points (double the emergency threshold)
3. 7 components with business logic violating M-CELL-1

**Refactoring Roadmap**:

**Phase 1: Address Critical Issues** (Estimated: 30 hours)
- Refactor sidebar.tsx into Cell structure (8 hours)
- Refactor version-comparison.tsx into Cell (8 hours)
- Convert 7 business components to Cells (14 hours)

**Phase 2: Stabilization** (Estimated: 8 hours)
- Extract large non-Cell components
- Add manifest assertions to all Cells
- Verify all tests pass

**Success Criteria for Resuming Migrations**:
- Architecture health score â‰¥60
- Zero monolithic files (all â‰¤500 lines)
- Architecture debt <10 points

**Next Steps**:
1. Review refactoring roadmap with team
2. Address critical monolithic files first
3. Re-run Phase 6 assessment after refactoring
4. If health â‰¥60, resume migrations

## Adoption Progress

**Overall ANDA Adoption**: 15%

- Components migrated to Cells: 11/~70 (16%)
- Type safety coverage: 99.89%
- Specialized procedure compliance: 100%

**Estimated Remaining Work**: 59 components Ã— 3 hours = 177 hours
