- **Files**: `apps/web/components/version-history-timeline.tsx` (435 lines)
- **Recommendation**: Convert to Cell with manifest (≥3 assertions) + pipeline
- **Migration Strategy**:
  - Extract timeline rendering logic to `components/` subdirectory
  - Extract state management to `hooks/` subdirectory
  - Create Cell orchestrator ≤400 lines in `components/cells/version-history-timeline-cell/`
  - Document ≥3 behavioral assertions in manifest

  - ✅ Architecture debt reduced to **1 point** (meets <10 threshold)
  - ✅ Enables progression to **EXCELLENT status** (≥90)
  - ✅ Completes ANDA adoption for business logic components

#### 2. Address sidebar.tsx Monolithic File (Policy Decision)
- **Issue**: 726-line file (exceeds 500-line emergency threshold)
- **Context**: This is a **shadcn/ui component** (third-party UI library), NOT application code
- **Impact**: 
  - 10 debt points
  - Does NOT affect agent navigability of business logic
  - Third-party components have different architectural constraints
- **Recommendation**: **Evaluate policy options**
- **Options**:
  - **Option A (Recommended)**: Accept as third-party exception, document rationale
    - Create policy: "Third-party UI library components exempt from size limits"
    - Document in architecture guide
    - Reduces architecture debt consideration from 11 to 1 point
    - Effort: 1 hour (documentation only)
  - **Option B**: Replace with custom implementation
    - Build custom sidebar meeting size constraints
    - Effort: 8 hours
    - Benefit: Eliminates exception, full architectural purity
  - **Option C**: Extract and customize
    - Copy shadcn component, break into smaller pieces
    - Effort: 4 hours
    - Benefit: Middle ground between A and B
- **Priority**: **HIGH** (for decision, may not require action)
- **Effort**: 0 hours (decision) OR 1-8 hours (depending on option)
- **Benefit**: 
  - Policy clarity for future third-party components
  - If Option A: Effective architecture debt = 1 point
  - If Option B/C: Architecture debt = 1 point (actual)

### Medium Priority (2)

#### 3. Reduce 'any' Type Usage
- **Issue**: 28 instances of 'any' types (0.13% of codebase)
- **Impact**: Minor type safety gaps, well below 5% threshold

  - Focus on high-traffic code paths first
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: Ongoing (opportunistic fixes, ~15 minutes per instance)
- **Benefit**: Improves type safety toward 100% coverage

#### 4. Maintain Architecture Health Monitoring
- **Issue**: Need to sustain current excellent trajectory
- **Recommendation**: Continue Phase 6 assessments after each migration
- **Strategy**:
  - Run architecture health assessment after every migration
  - Track trends to detect early degradation
  - Update strategic recommendations based on findings
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: Automated (built into workflow, ~5 minutes per migration)
- **Benefit**: Early detection of any future architectural drift

### Low Priority (1)

#### 5. Document Third-Party Component Policy
- **Issue**: Need clear policy for third-party/shadcn components vs. application code
- **Recommendation**: Document size limit exceptions for UI library components
- **Strategy**:
  - Add section to architecture guide: "Third-Party Component Exceptions"
  - Define criteria for acceptable exceptions
  - Document rationale for sidebar.tsx exception
  - Provide guidance for future third-party components
- **Priority**: LOW (not blocking, but improves clarity)
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Benefit**: 
  - Clarity for future architectural decisions
  - Prevents confusion about mandate compliance
  - Documents intent vs. strict rule application
