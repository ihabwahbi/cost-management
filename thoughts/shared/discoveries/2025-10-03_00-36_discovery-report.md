**Type**: Page Component (Client)  
**Score**: **95 / 100**  
**Migration Complexity**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**  
**Estimated Duration**: **8-12 hours**

---

## üìã SELECTION RATIONALE

### Primary Factors (85 points)
1. ‚úÖ **Direct Supabase Calls** (+30 points)
   - **8 database queries** bypassing tRPC layer
   - Tables accessed: `po_line_items`, `projects`, `cost_breakdown`, `po_mappings`
   - Critical architectural violation requiring immediate remediation

2. ‚úÖ **Type Safety Gaps** (+25 points)
   - **1 'any' type** detected (`formatRecentActivity` function)
   - Room for TypeScript improvements during migration

3. ‚úÖ **High Usage** (+20 points)
   - **Main landing page** - HIGHEST traffic component
   - First page users see when accessing application
   - Core user experience touchpoint

4. ‚úÖ **Critical Path** (+10 points)
   - Primary dashboard orchestration
   - Contains KPI metrics, charts, and recent activity
   - Essential for daily user workflows

### Secondary Factors (10 points)
5. ‚úÖ **User-Facing** (+5 points)
   - Directly visible to all users
   - High visibility for migration success

6. ‚úÖ **Medium Complexity** (+5 points)
   - 522 lines (borderline medium-high)
   - Simple state: 4 `useState` hooks (metrics, loading, refreshing, error)
   - Self-contained: No external library dependencies with DB calls
   - Feasible for autonomous execution

### Risk Assessment: **LOW-MEDIUM**

**Positive Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Self-contained logic (all DB calls in single file)
- ‚úÖ Clear data flow (fetch ‚Üí transform ‚Üí display)
- ‚úÖ Simple state management (4 hooks)
- ‚úÖ Well-structured helper functions
- ‚úÖ No blocking dependencies (doesn't depend on unmigrated libraries)

**Considerations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 522 lines (approaching high complexity threshold)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 8 Supabase queries to migrate to tRPC
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time subscriptions via `useRealtimeDashboard` hook
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-refresh interval (5 minutes) needs preservation

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Similar complexity to successfully migrated `financial-control-matrix` (401 lines, 14 tests passing)
- Phased migration approach: Read operations ‚Üí Real-time ‚Üí Auto-refresh
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

## üîç TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Database Operations (8 Queries)

| Query | Line | Table | Purpose | Complexity |
|-------|------|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | 138-144 | `po_line_items` | Unmapped POs count (left join) | Medium |
| 2 | 147-149 | `po_line_items` | Total PO value aggregation | Low |
| 3 | 152-154 | `projects` | Active projects count | Low |
| 4 | 157-159 | `cost_breakdown` | Budget data for variance | Low |
| 5 | 171-173 | `po_mappings` | Actual spend for variance | Low |
| 6 | 182-196 | `po_mappings` | Recent activity (complex joins) | High |
| 7 | 63-83 | `cost_breakdown` | Category breakdown (helper) | Medium |
| 8 | 86-115 | `po_line_items` | Timeline data (helper) | Medium |

**Migration Strategy:**
- Create `dashboard.getMainMetrics` tRPC procedure (queries 1-5)
- Create `dashboard.getRecentActivity` tRPC procedure (query 6)
- Create `dashboard.getCategoryBreakdown` tRPC procedure (query 7)
- Create `dashboard.getTimelineData` tRPC procedure (query 8)

### State Management

```typescript
const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState<DashboardMetrics | null>(null)  // Main data
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)                           // Initial load
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState(false)                    // Manual refresh
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)                // Error handling
```

**Migration Plan:**
- Convert to tRPC React Query hooks (automatic loading/error states)
- Preserve refreshing state for manual refresh UX
- Maintain auto-refresh interval logic

### Business Logic

1. **Total PO Value Calculation** (line 163-164)
   - Aggregates `line_value` from PO line items
   - Migration: Move to tRPC procedure

2. **Budget Variance Calculation** (line 166-179)
   - Compares total budget vs. actual spend
   - Formula: `((actual - budget) / budget) * 100`
   - Migration: Move to tRPC procedure

3. **Recent Activity Formatting** (line 32-59)
   - Transforms mappings into user-friendly activity feed
   - Relative time calculation ("2 mins ago", "3 hours ago")
   - Migration: Keep in component (presentation logic)

4. **Category Breakdown Aggregation** (line 62-83)
   - Groups costs by category, top 6 only
   - Simulates 85% actual spend vs. budget
   - Migration: Move to tRPC procedure

5. **Timeline Data Grouping** (line 86-115)
   - Groups by month from invoice dates
   - Migration: Move to tRPC procedure

### Dependencies

**Imported Components:**
- `AppShell` - Layout wrapper
- `SmartKPICard` - Reusable KPI display (NOT a Cell, remains as-is)
- UI components from `/ui/*` (Badge, Card, Button, Skeleton, Alert)
- Chart components from `recharts`

**Imported Hooks:**
- `useToast` - Toast notifications
- `useRealtimeDashboard` - Real-time subscriptions (uses Supabase directly)

**External Libraries:**
- `@/lib/supabase/client` - Direct client usage (to be removed)
- `recharts` - Chart rendering (stays)
- `lucide-react` - Icons (stays)

**Migration Impact:**
- ‚úÖ No blocking dependencies on unmigrated components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `useRealtimeDashboard` hook also uses Supabase - may need parallel migration or refactor

## üìä ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

### 2nd Place: `apps/web/app/projects/[id]/dashboard/page.tsx` (90 points)
**Why Not Selected:**
- **Higher complexity**: Depends on `lib/dashboard-metrics.ts` (15+ queries) and `lib/pl-tracking-service.ts` (20+ queries)
- **Blocking dependencies**: Would require migrating 2 service layer libraries first
- **Longer timeline**: 12-16 hours due to dependency chain
- **Risk**: Higher failure probability due to multiple moving parts

**Strategic Note:** This becomes next candidate AFTER service libraries migrated.

### 3rd Place: `apps/web/app/po-mapping/page.tsx` (65 points)
**Why Not Selected:**
- **Lower score**: Only 65 points vs. 95
- **Lower impact**: Feature-specific page with lower traffic
- **Less critical**: Not in primary user flow

**Strategic Note:** Good candidate for future quick win.

### EXCLUDED: `apps/web/app/projects/page.tsx` (Score N/A)
**Why Excluded:**
- **Extreme complexity**: 2000+ lines, 25+ state hooks
- **TOO LARGE** for autonomous execution in single migration
- **Recommendation**: Split into 4 separate Cells before migration
  - `ProjectListCell`
  - `CostBreakdownCell`
  - `ForecastManagementCell`
  - `POMappingIntegrationCell`

### EXCLUDED: `apps/web/components/dashboard/project-alerts.tsx` (Score N/A)
**Why Excluded:**
- **ORPHANED**: Zero imports detected across entire codebase
- **Dead code**: Never integrated into application
- **Recommendation**: DELETE rather than migrate (saves 190 LOC)

### Success Patterns Identified
1. ‚úÖ **Self-contained components** migrate successfully (kpi-card, budget-timeline-chart)
2. ‚úÖ **Complex orchestrators** succeed with phased approach (details-panel family)
3. ‚úÖ **Critical bug discovery** during migration adds value (financial-control-matrix fixed budget versioning)
4. ‚úÖ **Emergency scope expansion** manageable when well-justified (budget-timeline-chart P&L tracking)

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Continue momentum** - No failures to learn from, current approach working
2. **Maintain complexity threshold** - Medium or lower for autonomous execution
3. **Prioritize high-traffic pages** - Maximize user-facing impact
4. **Defer giant components** - Split `apps/web/app/projects/page.tsx` before attempting
