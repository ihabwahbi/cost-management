## ✅ Selected Migration Target

### Component Details
- **File**: `apps/web/components/filter-sidebar.tsx`
- **Current Lines**: 422
- **Current Location**: `apps/web/components/` (NON-COMPLIANT)
- **Target Location**: `apps/web/components/cells/filter-sidebar-cell/`
- **Active Imports**: 1 (po-mapping page)
- **Mandate Violation**: M-CELL-1 (All functionality must be in Cells)

### Scoring Breakdown

| Factor | Points | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Non-Cell Business Logic** | +20 | Has useState/useEffect but NOT in /cells/ (HIGH violation) |
| **Anti-Pattern (Large File)** | +15 | 422 lines (>300 threshold for non-Cell components) |
| **Type Safety Issues** | +25 | Line 86: `onFilterChange: (filters: any) => void` |
| **High Complexity** | +15 | 6 state hooks + complex date preset calculations |
| **User-Facing** | +5 | Core PO mapping filter feature |
| **TOTAL** | **80** | **HIGH severity** |

### Complexity Assessment

**Complexity: HIGH** (prioritize - architectural debt removal)

**State Management**:
- 6 useState hooks:
  - `location` (string)
  - `fmtPo` (boolean)
  - `mappingStatus` (string)
  - `poNumbers` (string)
  - `dateRange` (DateRange | undefined)
  - `selectedPreset` (string | null)

**Business Logic**:
- `getDatePresets()` function (lines 46-83)
  - Calculates: Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30/90 days
  - Calculates: This month, Last month, This quarter, This year
- `getActiveFilters()` function (line 99+)
- Auto-applies filters on change (useEffect)
- Active filter tracking and badge display

**Dependencies**:
- **Database Tables**: None (pure client-side filtering)
- **External APIs**: None
- **tRPC Procedures**: None
- **Imported By**: `apps/web/app/po-mapping/page.tsx`
- **UI Components**: 
  - Card, Label, Select, Textarea, Button, Badge
  - Calendar, Popover (shadcn/ui)

## 🎯 Selection Rationale

### Primary Factors

1. **Architectural Compliance Violation (HIGH)**
   - Component has business logic (6 state hooks, complex calculations)
   - Located outside `/cells/` directory
   - Violates M-CELL-1: All functionality must be in Cells
   - Severity: HIGH priority for architectural alignment

2. **Type Safety Gap**
   - Line 86: `onFilterChange: (filters: any) => void`
   - Weakens type safety guarantees
   - Should use explicit filter interface

3. **High Complexity = High Debt**
   - 422 lines (exceeds 300-line threshold for non-Cell components)
   - 6 state hooks (complex state management)
   - Multiple business logic functions (date presets, filter aggregation)
   - Philosophy: High complexity = High priority for refactoring

4. **Clean Migration Path**
   - No database dependencies (pure UI logic)
   - No tRPC dependencies
   - Single responsibility: Filter management
   - Clear Cell extraction opportunity

### Secondary Factors

5. **Active Usage**
   - Used by PO mapping page (core feature)
   - User-facing component (visible impact)
   
6. **Consolidation Opportunity**
   - Similar to `dashboard-filters.tsx` (187 lines, orphaned)
   - Could share date preset logic across codebase
   - Potential for reusable filter Cell pattern

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: Low-Medium

**Low Risk Factors**:
- ✅ No database dependencies
- ✅ Pure UI/state logic
- ✅ Clear component boundaries
- ✅ Single import (isolated usage)

**Medium Risk Factors**:
- ⚠️ Complex state management (6 hooks)
- ⚠️ Date calculation logic (requires careful testing)
- ⚠️ Filter aggregation logic

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Extract `getDatePresets()` to shared utility
- Create explicit TypeScript interfaces for filters
- Comprehensive unit tests for date calculations
- Integration tests for filter behavior
