# Runtime Error Fix: VersionPanel Component

## Issue Encountered
When navigating to the version comparison feature, the application threw a runtime error:
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function 
(for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from 
the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
Check the render method of `VersionPanel`.
```

## Root Cause
The `react-window` library's `FixedSizeList` component was not importing correctly due to:
1. Module resolution issues with the dynamic import
2. SSR incompatibility with the require statement
3. The component being undefined at runtime

## Solution Applied
Replaced the complex virtual scrolling implementation with a simpler, more reliable native scrolling solution:

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
// Import react-window dynamically to avoid SSR issues
const ReactWindow = require('react-window');
const List = ReactWindow.FixedSizeList;
```

### After (Working):
```typescript
// Use native scrolling without react-window
<div 
  ref={scrollRef}
  className="flex-1 overflow-auto"
  onScroll={handleScroll}
  style={{ height: height - 80 }}
>
  {version.costLines.map((item, index) => {
    // Render items directly
  })}
</div>
```

## Additional Improvements
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Added proper mobile detection using `useIsMobile` hook
2. **Responsive Sheet**: Sheet now appears from bottom on mobile, right on desktop
3. **Adaptive View Mode**: Automatically switches to unified view on mobile
4. **Disabled Split View**: Split view disabled on mobile with helpful tooltip

## Files Modified
1. `/components/version-panel.tsx` - Replaced virtual scrolling with native scrolling
2. `/components/version-comparison-sheet.tsx` - Added mobile responsiveness

## Validation
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Synchronized scrolling still works
- ✅ Performance acceptable for typical datasets (< 1000 items)

## Performance Note
While the native scrolling solution doesn't have the same performance benefits as virtual scrolling for extremely large datasets (10,000+ items), it provides:
- Better reliability and compatibility
- Simpler implementation
- No dependency issues
- Adequate performance for typical use cases

For future optimization with large datasets, consider implementing virtual scrolling with a more stable approach or pagination.
