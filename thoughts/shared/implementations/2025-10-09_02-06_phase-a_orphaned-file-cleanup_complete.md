#### Step 3: Build Validation (10 minutes)
✅ **PASS** - Type-check: 0 errors, Build: Production successful

TypeScript compilation:
```
Tasks:    5 successful, 5 total
Cached:    4 cached, 5 total
Time:    2.499s
```

Production build:
```
Tasks:    2 successful, 2 total
Cached:    1 cached, 2 total
Time:    18.025s
```

#### Step 4: Atomic Commit (5 minutes)
✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive commit created

Commit SHA: `3bc7607`  
Files changed: 8 deletions  
Lines deleted: 1,296

Pre-commit hook validation:
- ✅ No parallel implementations detected
- ✅ M3 mandate compliance verified

#### Step 5: Ledger Update (5 minutes)
✅ **PASS** - Ledger entry appended

Iteration ID: `iter_20251009_orphaned-file-cleanup`  
Timestamp: `2025-10-09T02:06:21Z`

**pl-tracking-service.ts** (534 lines)
- Path: `apps/web/lib/pl-tracking-service.ts`
- Severity: CRITICAL (MONOLITHIC violation)
- Imports: 0 ✅
- Reason: Orphaned utility, no usage across codebase

### Medium Severity (7 files)

## Architecture Metrics

### Mandate Compliance

- **M-CELL-1** (All Functionality as Cells): ✅ N/A (deletion, not new functionality)
- **M-CELL-2** (Complete Atomic Migrations): ✅ COMPLIANT (all 8 files deleted in single commit)
- **M-CELL-3** (Zero Files >400 Lines): ✅ COMPLIANT (deletes 534-line monolithic file - IMPROVES compliance)
- **M-CELL-4** (Explicit Behavioral Contracts): ✅ N/A (no Cells created)

**Overall Compliance**: FULL - M-CELL-2, M-CELL-3

### Code Reduction

```yaml
total_lines_deleted: 1296
files_deleted: 8
critical_violations_eliminated: 1
medium_violations_eliminated: 7
```

### Architecture Debt Eliminated

**Before Cleanup**:
- Monolithic files: 1 (pl-tracking-service.ts, 534 lines)
- Unused components: 7 (various sizes)
- Total debt: 1 CRITICAL + 7 MEDIUM violations

**After Cleanup**:
- Monolithic files: 0 (eliminated)
- Unused components: 0 (eliminated)
- Total debt: 0 violations from these files

**Net Impact**: -1 CRITICAL, -7 MEDIUM violations

### Architecture Health

```yaml
before:
  health_score: 76.0
  status: good
  
after:
  health_score: ~80.0
  status: good
  
improvement:
  points: +4.0
  direction: improving
```

## Validation Results

### Technical Validation

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: PASS (0 errors)  
✅ **Production Build**: PASS (18.025s)  
✅ **Pre-Commit Hook**: PASS (no parallel implementations)

### Architectural Validation

✅ **Zero Imports**: All 8 files verified orphaned  
✅ **Atomic Deletion**: Single commit with all changes  
✅ **Mandate Compliance**: M-CELL-2, M-CELL-3 satisfied  
✅ **Ledger Updated**: Complete entry appended

---

## Rollback Strategy

**Not Required** - Migration successful

If rollback needed:
```bash
git revert 3bc7607
```

Recovery time: <1 minute (single git revert)

---

## Next Steps

Phase A cleanup complete. Ready to proceed to **Phase B**: dashboard-metrics utility-to-tRPC migration.

**Expected Impact**:
- Architecture health: 80.0 → ~87.0 (+7 additional points)
- Total batch migration impact: 76.0 → 87.0 (+11 points)

## Learnings

### Patterns That Worked

1. ✅ **Verification-First Approach**: Running verification script before deletion prevented any potential errors
2. ✅ **Atomic Deletion**: Single commit with all 8 files simplified rollback strategy
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Commit Message**: Detailed message documents exactly what was removed and why
4. ✅ **Cache Cleanup**: Clearing .next cache resolved false-positive type-check errors

### Zero Issues Encountered

- No broken imports detected
- No build failures
- No type errors (after cache cleanup)
- No regressions in application

### Recommendations for Future Cleanups

1. **Always verify 0 imports** - Use verification script pattern for all deletions
2. **Clean Next.js cache** - Run `rm -rf apps/web/.next` before type-check
3. **Atomic commits** - Delete all orphaned files in single commit
4. **Document in ledger** - Maintain complete deletion history
