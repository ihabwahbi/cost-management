## Critical Fix Summary: Version 0 Data Corruption

### The Problem:
When creating forecasts with new items, those items were being saved to the cost_breakdown table, corrupting the "original" Version 0 data.

### Root Cause:
The saveForecastVersion function was adding ALL new entries to cost_breakdown, even for forecast versions (not just initial budget).

### The Fix Applied:

1. **Prevent New Entries in Forecasts**
   - Only the initial budget can add entries to cost_breakdown
   - Forecast versions (1+) can only modify existing entries
   - Added checks to prevent new entries from being saved to cost_breakdown

2. **Version 0 Loading Logic Enhanced**
   - First checks if Version 0 exists in forecast_versions table
   - If it exists, loads from budget_forecasts (the correct source)
   - If not, falls back to cost_breakdown table with ordering by creation date

3. **User Notifications**
   - Added toast notifications when users try to add new items in forecasts
   - Clear messaging about this limitation

### Data Cleanup Needed:
For projects with corrupted data, you may need to:
1. Identify which cost_breakdown entries are original vs added later
2. Remove entries that were incorrectly added during forecast creation
3. Recreate Version 0 in forecast_versions if needed

### Future Improvements:
- Add a flag to cost_breakdown to mark initial vs forecast entries
- Consider allowing "virtual" entries in forecasts that dont modify cost_breakdown
- Implement proper version control for the base budget
